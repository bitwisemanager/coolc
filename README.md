# Building a Compiler for the COOL programming language

This repository culminates all the content presented by the [Stanford Online's Compilers course](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers?index=product&queryID=e23798a2661f2ae4e6ad33d94a166be5&position=5&linked_from=autocomplete)
on [Edx](https://www.edx.org/). The self-paced course is taught by [Alexander Aiken](https://www.edx.org/bio/alex-aiken)
and aims to build a compiler for the programming language's [COOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_(programming_language)),
designed by him.

The content includes lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type
checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems.
Resulting in a high-level language designed for humans which is systematically translated into a program written in
low-level assembly more suited to machines (specifically for
[MIPS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture#:~:text=MIPS%20(Microprocessor%20without%20Interlocked%20Pipelined,based%20in%20the%20United%20States.)))
